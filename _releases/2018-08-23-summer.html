  <h1>Your Summer update from Hystreet</h1>
  <p>If you've been using Hystreet regularly this month you've probably noticed quite a few updates and changes we've rolled out to make the system a little easier to use day-to-day.</p>
  <p>A lot of this is in preparation for some even bigger changes we're planning on rolling out in the final quarter of this year, so watch this space!</p>
  <p><strong>See below for more details on everything we've updated:</strong></p>

      </div>
      <div class="columns right large-6">
        <h2>Overall visual improvements</h2>
        <p>We have essentially overhauled the way the agent-side of your Hystreet platform looks and feels.
          Mostly everything is still where you expect it to be, only now it should be a little bit nicer to use.</p>

    <div  class="row mb-15">
      <div class="columns right large-6">
        <img src="/images/releases/admin-dropdown.png" alt="screenshot of admin section drop-down nav">
      </div>
      <div class="columns left large-6">
        <h2>Clearer admin menu</h2>
        <p>The 'admin' area is now accessible to users with access to it by clicking the 'admin' button in the top right corner of every page.
          This makes it a little more accessible, and breaks it off from the 'day-to-day' menu options, which still live in the main menu.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="columns right large-6">
        <h2>Stay updated at a glance</h2>
        <p>Property statuses on the property page are now labelled and colour-coded based on status, making it easier for you to see the information you and your staff need straight away.</p>
