    <h1>Hystreet's Spring Update</h1>
    <p><strong>Spring is a time of year when everything seems to brighten up and look a bit prettier - you may notice that your Hystreet platform also looks a lot fresher, too.</strong></p>
    <p>Over the past few months, we have been working closely with agents using Hystreet to make the platform much nicer to use for agents and staff members -
      these updates have now gone live on Hystreet and we're really excited to tell you about them!</p>
    <p>As always, we're really pleased that we have great customers that are willing and able to provide the feedback we need to continue to grow Hystreet into the best estate agent software in the world - thank you!</p>

      <h2>Property details at a glance</h2>
      <p>The first change we made as part of these updates has already been live for a number of weeks -
        your properties now have an easy-to-read sidebar that gives you all the information you may need to quickly grab - such as the full address, the sellers' details and the property status.</p>
      <p>We've also moved the booking link into this sidebar, making it much easier to find and send over to anyone who wants to book a viewing.</p>

    <div class="columns right large-6">
      <h2>Consistent, easy-to-find page actions, everywhere on the site.</h2>
      <p>We've moved all of the page action buttons (things like 'save', 'cancel', 'send email') to the footer for each page -
        this means that everything across the site is consistent, allowing you to work faster, and make easier, smoother progress through various sections of the staff site.</p>

      <h2>Plus buttons for whenever you are adding something new</h2>
      <p>As well as the revamped page actions mentioned above, we've also updated the action of adding something 'new' to Hystreet.</p>
      <p>Any time you have the option to add something to your platform - be that a property, client, appointment, or anything else - we've used a plus button to make it even easier to find.
        Not only does this save you time in your day-to-day use of Hystreet, but it makes it easier for new members of staff (or current staff that haven't used Hystreet much) to familiarise themselves with the system.</p>
