  <h1>Hystreet's Autumn Update</h1>
  <div class="mb-30">
    <p><strong>As a small business ourselves, we understand that running a small business (especially an estate agency) is difficult.</strong>
      Based on feedback from our customers, we've been working hard over the past few months to achieve the following:</p>
    <ol style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px">
      <li>We've made Hystreet more straightforward for you to set up and use than ever before.</li>
      <li>You have easier access to the information you need, when you need it, including information from customers.</li>
      <li>You're able to make educated business decisions based on how your customers are using Hystreet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As always, we're really pleased that we have great customers that are willing and able to provide the feedback we need to continue to grow Hystreet to be the best estate agent software in the world - thank you!</p>

      <h2>Google Analytics & Hystreet - a match made in heaven</h2>
      <p>Google Analytics is the most popular web analytics reporting software in the world.</p>
      <p>By linking Hystreet with your Google Analytics account, you're able to see what online marketing works for you, and you can put your money where your leads are.</p>

      <h2>Easy-to-find terms and conditions</h2>
      <p>Hystreet has always automatically stored a copy of the terms and conditions your customers sign, when they sign.
        You can now access these documents directly through your system, at any time.
        This means that if (touch wood) anything happens, you have easy access to those terms as they were at the point of instruction, no matter how long it's been since.</p>

      <h2>Publish your properties to OnTheMarket</h2>
      <p>Thanks to a few intrepid Hystreet customers, OnTheMarket have now fully finalised their link with Hystreet!
        This means if you use OnTheMarket, you can publish properties directly to them via Hystreet, just as you already can with Rightmove and Zoopla.</p>

      <h2>More pre-valuation questions!</h2>
      <p>We've expanded some of the questions a customer answers when booking a valuation, so you have a better idea of what to compare the property to price-wise, and help get a better valuation.</p>

      <h2>Prices at a glance</h2>
      <p>We've updated your internal property list to include prices next to each property, allowing you to find the property you're looking for much easier.
        Even better - the price updates dynamically as the property progresses through the sale, from valuation to offer.</p>
