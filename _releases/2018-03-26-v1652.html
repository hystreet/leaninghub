<ul>
  <li>The 'branch' dropdown when adding a new property is no longer limited to ten branches.</li>
  <li>Vendors who book new valuations and who amend existing once will now get different notification emails.</li>
  <li>Your 'Listing presentation' page now shows direct links to the property's portal listings, allowing you to easily see what your listings look like on portals.</li>
  <li>corrected typos on the housekeeping page when booking a take on.</li>
  <li>Sellers can now confirm that viewings took place so automated feedback request emails can be sent to buyers (feedback requests are coming soon!)</li>
</ul>
