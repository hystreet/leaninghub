  <h1>Getting Support</h1>
  <strong>Who can help me if I have an issue?</strong>
  <p>
  Our team is dedicated to providing you with a quality site, but we understand that sometimes might not work quite the way you expect it to. If you’ve found something that isn’t working, or if you just want some clarification, you can contact our tech wizards by hitting the ‘Support’ tab in the bottom left corner of your screen (as seen below).</P>

  <p>
  The box that appears in the centre on the page is where you tell us what email you want us to reply to, what’s gone wrong and how serious the issue is. Once you’ve filled those in, simply hit ‘Send Feedback’. From there, our wizards will pick up the issue and keep you updated at every step towards resolving the issue.</p>


  <strong>Can I request new features?</strong>
  <p>
  Yes! If you think of something that would be useful to have on the site, simply click ‘Support’ in the bottom left corner of your screen (as seen below). Use the box that appears in the centre of the screen to tell us what your ideas are. </p>

  Our tech team will then let you know via email whether implementing the suggested feature is possible or if we have already started developing it already. </p>
