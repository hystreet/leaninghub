      <a href="#panel1"><strong>Am I at risk of double bookings being made on the consumer site?</strong></a>
      <div id="panel1" class="content active">
        <p>No- the ability to book appoints in unavailable or already booked slots is solely on the staff site.
          Only time slots that are empty and marked as available show up in the form of checkboxes on the consumer site. </P>

      <a href="#panel2"><strong>Why can I book multiple appointments in the same slot on the staff site?</strong></a>
      <div id="panel2" class="content active">
        <p>We have made sure that you, as agents, have complete control over the properties you handle and their attached listings and appointments.
          Part of this is giving you the ability to book appointments in any time slot, regardless of the status of the slot itself.</P>
        <p>Exactly how you use this tool, is entirely up to you.
          See below to find out how this would allow you to host open days on properties.</p>

      <a href="#panel3"><strong>Are available booking slots taken from the agent's availability or the vendors?</strong></a>
      <div id="panel3" class="content active">
        <p>You have the ability to choose whether appointments are booked against your own availability (in cases where no vendor is present), against the buyers availability (for when the vendor is doing their own viewings), or against both availabilities at the same time (for accompanied viewings).
          When making a booking against both the agent’s and the vendor’s availabilities, the Hystreet system will only show on the consumer site appointment booking slots that are open for both.</P>
        <p>To change which availability you want to use, simply go to properties -> view (on the property in question) -> details -> manage and select the desired setting in the ‘viewings by’ drop down menu.</p>

      <a href="#panel4"><strong>Could I arrange an open day for a property?</strong></a>
      <div id="panel4" class="content active">
        <p>We understand that different properties require different strategies to sell.
          In some cases, you might think the best course of action would be setting up an open day.
          To do this, simply take all your bookings using the staff site.</P>
        <p>The first booking of the day will work as usual- set your agent’s availability in agent settings, then book a viewing and select the desired time.
          With the following bookings, you’ll notice that first time slot will say booked.
          You can book as many appointments in that time slot as you like- just let your buyers for each hour know what time you want them to show up.</p>
        <p>From there on, it is entirely up to you how many potential buyers you want to allow per hour, and how long the open day is held for.</p>
