      <div id="panel1" class="content active">
        <p>The easiest way to skip the payment step when getting your properties live is to go to <strong> Admin > branches > view (on your branch).</strong></p>
        <p>From there, change your Stripe keys to your test keys and run a test payment on the property.
          This will be treated as a normal payment on the system and will allow you to make the listing live, without incurring a real-world charge.</p>
        <p><em>TIP: we recommend that you add all of your existing listings in one go, then immediately change your Stripe keys back to your live keys.
          If you try to take a real-world payment using your Stripe keys, the payment will fail! </em></p>

        <p>To find your stripe keys, you’ll need to visit <a>https://dashboard.stripe.com/</a></P>
        <p>After logging in, follow the API link in the left hand column.</p>

        <p>After logging in, click 'developers' then follow the API link in the left hand column.
          This page will show you yours publishable (public) and secret live keys.
          You’ll need to enter these two keys in the branch settings on your staff to take payments. </p>
        <p>On the right hand side of the stripe API page you will see a toggle to swap between showing your live and test keys.
          Simply click this to show your test keys instead.</p>

        <p>If you’re unsure of which keys you are currently using, take a look at the fields where you’ve entered the keys on the staff site.
          Near the start of each key you will see either the words ‘test’ or ‘live’.</P>

      <a href="#panel3"><strong>Can I offer a deferred payment or No-sale-no-fee option? </strong></a>
      <div id="panel3" class="content active">
        <p> The Hystreet platform currently only supports fixed fee upfront payments.
          If you want your online service to use a different payment plan, you can bypass the 'instruct and pay step', then manage your payment outside of the Hystreet system.
          To bypass the payment, change over to your Stripe test keys and run a test payment on the property.</p>
        <p> Be sure to change your Stripe keys back after completing this bypass, so you can continue taking payments as normal.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> If you complete payment using this method you do so at your own risk, and will need to provide your clients with a printed version of your terms and conditions to sign </p>
