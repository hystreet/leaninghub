<h1>Can I run test properties?</h1>
<p>
It is possible to run test properties. In order to do so, a user on the staff site with admin rights will need enter your branchâ€™s stripe public and secret test keys by going to admin -> branches. While using the test keys, you will be able to complete test payments using the given test card details.</P>
<p>
Once you have finished testing, you will need to switch your stripe keys back to the live codes in order to continue handling real life products. If you are unsure of where to find your stripe keys, go <a href="http://learninghub.hystreet.co.uk/faqs/finding-stripe-keys/">here</a>.</p>
