<h1>Can I request new features?</h1>

<p>
Yes! If you think of something that would be useful to have on the site, simply click ‘Support’ in the bottom left corner of your screen (as seen below). Use the box that appears in the centre of the screen to tell us what your ideas are. </p>

Our tech team will then let you know via email whether implementing the suggested feature is possible or if we have already started developing it already. </p>
