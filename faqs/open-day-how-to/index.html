<h1>Could I arrange an open day for a property?</h1>
<p>
We understand that different properties require different strategies to sell. In some cases, you might think the best course of action would be setting up an open day. To do this, simply take all your bookings using the staff site.</P>
<p>
The first booking of the day will work as usual- set your agent’s availability in agent settings, then book a viewing and select the desired time. With the following bookings, you’ll notice that first time slot will say booked. You can book as many appointments in that time slot as you like- just let your buyers for each hour know what time you want them to show up.</p>
<p>
From there on, it is entirely up to you how many potential buyers you want to allow per hour, and how long the open day is held for. </P>
