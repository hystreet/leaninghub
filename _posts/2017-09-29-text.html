Some people can’t handle success, I can. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch.

Some people can’t handle success, I can. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up?
