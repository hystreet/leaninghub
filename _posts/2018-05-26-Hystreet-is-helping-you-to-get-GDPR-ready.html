<p>Over the last few weeks, the Hystreet team has been hard at work making changes to help you with GDPR.
  You'll notice a few changes to the consumer side of your Hystreet platform. Here's the rundown: </p>
<p> When your sellers first book a valuation for their property, they are now asked if they would like to opt-in to general marketing emails and other helpful services.
  Likewise, your buyers will also be asked about their contact preferences on the account creation step of booking a viewing.
  Here's what those contact preference options will look like for both buyers and sellers:</p>

<p>In addition, your existing clients will now be able to update their contact preferences by logging in, clicking the circle with their initials in the top right corner of the page and selecting <strong> My Preferences </strong> from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about these new features, we have updated our <strong><a href="/guides/buyer">Buyers</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/guides/seller">Sellers</a></strong> guides.</p>
<p>We are going to be adding more functionality in the upcoming weeks that will make it even easier for you to work with GDPR.
  In the mean time, if you receive any other requests under GDPR from your clients then let our support team know and theyâ€™ll be happy to assist.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding GDPR and what we are working on, get in touch with us using the support tab!</p>
