<p>Over the last few weeks, the hystreet team has been hard at work making the necessary changes for GPDR coming into effect.
  You'll now notice a few changes to the consumer side of your Hystreet platform; here's the rundown- </p>
<p> When your sellers first book a valuation for their property, they are now asked to set their contact preferences as part of creating their account.
  On the same page that they would usually enter their name, email, desired password and contact number, they will also be asked if they would like to opt-in to general marketing emails and other helpful services </p>
<p>Likewise, your buyers will also be asked about their contact preferences on the account creation step of booking a viewing.</p>
<p>In addition, all of your existing clients will now be able to update their contact preferences by logging in and going to <strong> account > preferences </strong>.</p>
<p> you'll will be able to read up on these new features in the <strong><a href="/guides/buyer">Buyers</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/guides/seller">Sellers</a></strong> guides over at the guides section of the Learning Hub!</p>

<p> We are going to be adding even more functionality in the upcoming weeks to give you a hand with GDPR, including giving you the ability to show your clients all of their stored information, should they ask for it.
  In the mean time, if any of your clients to request access to their information, let our support team know who will handle the request manually. </p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding GDPR and what we are working on, get in touch with us using the support tab!</p>
