    <h1> The Staff Site </h1>

  <div>
    <p> on this page, you'll find a rundown of the main functionality of the staff site: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-1"> Main Navigation </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-2"> The diary and the dashboard </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-3"> The Properties List </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-4"> Details Section </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-5"> Listing Section </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-6"> Compliance Section </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-7"> Appointments Section </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-8"> Offers section </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="#staff-site-part-9"> The buyers list </a> </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="staff-site-part-1"> Main Navigation </h2>
    <p> On signing in, you’ll be taken straight to the dashboard page.
      Use the bars at the top of the page to navigate around the site. </p>
    <img src="/images/staff-navigation.PNG">
    <p> The two buttons on the top bar say ‘admin’ and ‘logout’.
      They take you to the admin section and log you out of the staff site, respectively. The admin section is covered <a href ="http://learninghub.hystreet.co.uk/guides/admin-setup/">here.</a>
      On the second row, you’ll see the links to the ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-2">dashboard</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-3">properties</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-9">buyers</a>’ and ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-2">diary</a>’ sections. </p>
    <p> When viewing a property (we’ll get to that shortly) you’ll see another bar appear, with links to ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-4">details</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-5">listing</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-6">compliance</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-7">appointments</a>’ and ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-8">offers</a>’.

  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="staff-site-part-3"> The Properties List </h2>
    <p> In the properties section, you’ll see a table with all properties added through both the staff and consumer site.
      The left column shows the seller’s name and the centre shows the property address.
      To the right of each entry on the table you’ll see ‘view’ button, which will take you into the details section for that property.</p>
    <p>If this list of properties exceeds ten entries, it will be split up into multiple pages.
      you’ll see page numbers underneath the list to move between the pages.</p>
    <img src="/images/pagination.PNG">
    <p> Above and to the right of the list, there’s an ‘add property’ button.
      Clicking this takes you to a page to fill out the new properties address, and use the two drop-down fields to select the branch and agent tied to the property.
      Filling out these details then clicking ‘save’ will add the property to the property list.</p>
    <img src="/images/add-property-button.PNG">
  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="staff-site-part-4"> Details Section </h2>
    <p> above the main body of the page, you’ll see a set of tabs. Use these to move between the subsections of the details section. </p>
    <img src="/images/details-subsections.PNG">
    <h3> Valuation Details </h3>
    <p> When clicking view on a property in the property list, you’ll immediately be brought here.
      This page shows all the information from when the property was added, but you’ll also see the fields for recording any information gathered at the valuation.
      These fields look like this: </p>
    <img src="/images/staff-valuation-details.PNG">
    <h3> Seller Details </h3>
    <p> You can tie sellers to the added property here.
      Multiple sellers can be added by clicking the ‘add seller’ button on the top right of the page.
      Doing so will bring up an empty seller details field, where you can add the name, email address and contact number for the seller. </p>
    <img src="/images/adding-seller.PNG">
    <p> To make sure that sellers aren’t accidently duplicated, the system checks to make sure the emails are valid and have not already been recorded elsewhere.
      If clicking save doesn’t successfully add the seller, please check that the email has correctly been entered. </p>
    <h3> Valuation Reports </h3>
    <p> Once an agent has completed a valuation on the property.
      The highest, lowest, and recommended values are recorded here.
      Once the fields have been filled and saved, hit send report.
      This will send the values over to the consumer site, so the buyer can then make a decision on instructing the agent to sell their home. </p>
    <img src="/images/staff-valuation-report.PNG">
    <h3> Taking payment </h3>
    <p> The payments page shows a log of all the payments made relating to the property.
      To take a new payment, hit ‘new payment’ in the corner.
      This will lead you to a page where you can set the fees for the payment and take the card details.</p>
    <img src="/images/staff-take-payment.PNG">
    <p><i> TIP: if you’re running a test property through the system, make sure you are using the correct stripe keys.
      To learn more about doing test payments, go <a href="http://learninghub.hystreet.co.uk/guides/admin-setup/#admin-part-3">here</a></p></i>
    <h3> The Manage Tab </h3>
    <p> The Manage section is where you can update the branch and agent tied to the property and record any sale board or access requirements. </p>
    <p> The viewings by field is where you can set which availability is shown on the consumer site.
      Set this to seller if the seller is handling their own viewings, agent if the agent is handling the viewings, or both if the seller is handling the viewings with the accompaniment of an agent. </p>
    <p> At the bottom of the form there’s a ‘withdrawn’ checkbox.
      Check this if you no longer want the listing to appear on the consumer site. </p>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="staff-site-part-5"> Listing Section </h2>
    <h3> Presentation </h3>
    <p> This page shows a summary of the listing. </p>
      On the first time viewing this page, there won’t be much to see, but it will be filled out as the listing is put together.
    <p> The picture you will be able to see is the featured image- the image shown on the ‘browse properties’ page of the consumer site.
      To the right of the picture you’ll see the description you have written on the listing details section.
      Below the image, you’ll see an outline of the rooms included in the listing and the stated price. </p>
    <p> At the bottom of the page, there’s a set of booking links.
      Copy and paste these to clients (i.e. via email) to give them a direct route to book a viewing on the property. </p>
    <p> In the top right on the page, you’ll see two buttons: ‘send for approval’ and ‘approve listing for seller’.</p>
    <img src="/images/send-for-approval-buttons.PNG">
    <p> Once the listing has been fully composed, hit send for approval to notify the seller.
      They’ll then be able to look over the listing before it shows on the consumer site.
      If, for some reason, the seller isn’t able to approve it (if they don’t have access to a computer, for example) hit approve listing for seller to approve it from the staff site. </p>
    <img src="/images/listing-approved.PNG">
    <p> Once it has been approved, you’ll see a message notifying you underneath the featured image. </p>
    <h3> Details </h3>
    <p> The Listing details page is where you’ll edit the main text of the listing.
      At the top of the page there is a description field.
      Enter the main property description here- don’t worry, this field will expand as you type (there’s no character limit). </p>
    <p> Underneath the description, you’ll see a section for recording the sale status, Price qualifier and asking price.
      To the right of this you’ll see a set of property fields.
      It may seem unnecessary to provide this information again, but this is to include the information on the listing.
      The first time you entered property details was to record the information on the database. </p>
    <p> Underneath the property details section, you’ll see a field to add a key feature.
      Clicking ‘add key feature’ builds the list. </p>
    <p> <i> TIP: hit save regularly on this page to make sure nothing is lost if your laptop runs out of power or you lose internet connectivity. </i> </p>
    <h3> Rooms </h3>
    <p> A list of all rooms added here will be visible on the listing page on the consumer site.
      To add a room, click the ‘add room’ button at the top of the page. </p>
    <img src="/images/add-room.PNG">
    <p> On the next page, you’ll see four fields.
      Anything put into the first two fields will be shown on the consumer site.
      The ‘room type’ drop down will determine which logo shows next to the room name and dimensions on the consumer listing. </p>
    <img src="/images/room-list-consumer.PNG">
    <p> Any text entered the ‘description’ field is included on the published listing on portal sites. </p>
