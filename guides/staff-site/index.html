    <h1> The Staff Site </h1>

  <div> <p> On this page, you'll find a rundown of the main functionality of the staff site: </p>
    <ol>

    <p> When viewing a property (we’ll get to that shortly) you’ll see another bar appear, with links to ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-4">details</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-5">listing</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-6">compliance</a>’, ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-7">appointments</a>’ and ‘<a href="#staff-site-part-8">offers</a>’. </p>

      For more on these details pages, go <a href="#staff-site-part-7"> here. </a> </p>
    <p> The diary page shows all a table of all your upcoming appointments.

      To the right of each entry on the table you’ll see ‘view’ button, which will take you into the details section for that property.</p>
    <p>If this list of properties exceeds ten entries, it will be split up into multiple pages.
      you’ll see page numbers underneath the list to move between the pages.</p>

    <h3> Valuation Details </h3>
    <p> You’ll immediately be brought here when you click view on a property in the property list.
      This page shows all the information from when the property was added, but you’ll also see the fields for recording any information gathered at the valuation.

        <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3> Seller Details </h3>
    <p> You can tie sellers to the added property here.
      Multiple sellers can be added by clicking the ‘add seller’ button on the top right of the page.
      Doing so will bring up an empty seller details field, where you can add the name, email address and contact number for the seller. </p>

        <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> To make sure that sellers aren’t accidently duplicated, the system checks to make sure the emails are valid and have not already been recorded elsewhere.
      If clicking save doesn’t successfully add the seller, please check that the email has correctly been entered. </p>
    <h3> Valuation Reports </h3>
    <p> Once an agent has completed a valuation on the property.
      The highest, lowest, and recommended values are recorded here.
      Once the fields have been filled and saved, hit send report.
      This will send the values over to the consumer site, so the buyer can then make a decision on instructing the agent to sell their home. </p>

    <h3> Taking payment </h3>
    <p> The payments page shows a log of all the payments made relating to the property.
      To take a new payment, hit ‘new payment’ in the corner.
      This will lead you to a page where you can set the fees for the payment and take the card details.</p>

    <h3> The Manage Tab </h3>
    <p> The Manage section is where you can update the branch and agent tied to the property and record any sale board or access requirements. </p>
    <p> The 'viewings by' field is where you can set which availability is shown on the consumer site.
      Set this to seller if the seller is handling their own viewings, agent if the agent is handling the viewings, or both if the seller is handling the viewings with the accompaniment of an agent. </p>
    <p> At the bottom of the form there’s a ‘withdrawn’ checkbox.
      Check this if you no longer want the listing to appear on the consumer site. </p>

    <h3> Presentation </h3>
    <p> This page shows a summary of the listing. </p>
      On the first time viewing this page, there won’t be much to see, but it will be filled out as the listing is put together.
    <p> The picture you will be able to see is the featured image- the image shown on the ‘browse properties’ page of the consumer site.
      To the right of the picture you’ll see the description you have written on the listing details section.
      Below the image, you’ll see an outline of the rooms included in the listing and the stated price. </p>
    <p> At the bottom of the page, there’s a set of booking links.
      Copy and paste these to clients (i.e. via email) to give them a direct route to book a viewing on the property. </p>
    <p> In the top right on the page, you’ll see two buttons: ‘send for approval’ and ‘approve listing for seller’.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p> Once the listing has been fully composed, hit send for approval to notify the seller.
      They’ll then be able to look over the listing before it shows on the consumer site.
      If, for some reason, the seller isn’t able to approve it (if they don’t have access to a computer, for example) hit approve listing for seller to approve it from the staff site. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">

    <p> Underneath the description, you’ll see a section for recording the sale status, Price qualifier and asking price.
      To the right of this you’ll see a set of fields for the property type and location.
      It may seem unnecessary to provide this information again, but this is to include the information on the listing.
      The first time you entered property details was to record the information on the database. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">

    <h3> Fact Find </h3>
    <p> Before a listing can be made live, you’ll need to complete a property fact find.
      If the vendor has completed this form from the consumer site, you’ll just need to review it.
      If you’re happy to accept the fact find, set the ‘fact find review status’ field at the top of the page to ‘approved’ then click save.
      Otherwise, you can set the field to ‘requires action’. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">

    <p> If you are completing the fact find yourself, on behalf of the vendor, just fill out the form as necessary then click save at the top of the page. </p>
    <p><i> Tip: the review status must be set to approved before the listing will show on the consumer site.
      The ‘completed’ status suggests that the form has been filled out, but still requires an agent to review it. </i></p>
    <h3> ID </h3>
    <p> ID checks can be started from both the staff and consumer site, and are completed using an Experian check service.
      To start an ID check from the consumer site, click ‘start ID check’ in the top left of the page.
      On the following page, you’ll see a space where all the IDs being checked will be listed.

    <p> This will bring up the necessary fields for the check.
      You’ll also see a state field- in some cases, you might not need to run the check (i.e. if you have previously completed the check outside of the platform).
      In these cases, you can set the state field to ‘superceded’.
      Otherwise, you can leave the field blank for now. </p>
    <p> When the form has been filled out, hit save.
      You’ll be taken back to the list of IDs from the page before, where’ll you’ll see the ID state marked as ‘pending’.</p>

    <p> Clicking details on this page will give you some information on the buyers’ financial position.
      this information will be collected when the buyer books a viewing from the consumer site.
      You will also be able to resend the email confirmation link to buyers if the buyer has not confirmed their email address already. </p>

    <p> Buyers will need to confirm their email address to book a viewing.
      If they are unconfirmed the viewing will only be provisionally booked; you’ll see the appointment from the staff site, but sellers won’t be notified. </p>
    <h3> Launch </h3>
    <p> The launch appointments list works the same as the others.
      Click view on the appoints in the list to view which agent is handling the appointment and the timeslots.
      You won’t see a details button on this page like you will for viewings or valuations, but you will see a send summary button.
      This just sends a summary of the appointment to the seller via email.  </p>
    <h3> Availability </h3>
    <p> This is where agents can manage the seller’s availability.
      This works the same way as the agent’s availability section- simply check the boxes to make those timeslots as available for the seller, then hit save </p>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="staff-site-part-8"> Offers Section </h2>
    <p> Any offers made will show up on this page.
      To make a new offer on behalf of a buyer through the staff site, click ‘make offer’ on the top right of the page.
      This will bring up a blank offer form. </p>
    <p> At the top of this page, you’ll see a ‘select buyer’ field for you to select the buyer who is making the offer.
      Below this, you’ll see fields for the offered amount, the status of the offer, and any additional offer conditions.
      By default, the status of the offer will be open. </p>
    <p> Underneath this, you’ll see checkboxes to confirm that the buyer is not an estate agent, is financially qualified, and has accepted your terms and conditions.
      You’ll need to accept the terms and conditions before an offer can be submitted. </p>
    <p> On the right of the screen, you’ll see fields to collect funding information.
      If an offer is being funded by the sale of another property, there’s a field to record the progression of that sale.
      If it’s being funded by a mortgage, there’s also a dropdown to record the mortgage status.
      If these fields aren’t applicable you can leave them blank. </p>
    <p> When you save this page, you’ll see it from the offers page.
      You can go back into the offer to update it by clicking view on it.
      Update the state of the offer to accepted, rejected or withdrawn.
      If the buyer wants to withdraw their offer, there’s a field where they can leave a withdrawal statement.
      Likewise, there’s a field to include a seller’s written response when accepting or rejecting the statement. </p>
    <p> Any updates to the offer status will be displayed by showing a ribbon in the top right corner of the featured image on the consumer site. </p>
  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="staff-site-part-9"> The Buyers List </h2>
    <p> Any client wishing to book a viewing or make an offer on a property need to be added here.
      Booking a viewing on the consumer site will automatically add them.
    <p> The buyers page shows a list of all buyers added on both the staff and consumer site.
      Buyers are added in groups so that people can buy properties in partnerships.
      For example, a team of investors may want to buy a property; each investor could have their own log in and any viewings or offers made would be on behalf of every buyer in that group. </p>
    <p> On the buyers list, the columns (from left to right) show buyers’ names in that group, their email addresses, any viewings they are booked in for, and a link to view the buyer group.</p>
    <p> On clicking view will allow you to see and edit the name, email address and contact number of each buyer in that group. </p>
      You can also send password reset emails from this page by clicking the button in the top right. </p>
    <p> TIP: Make sure you hit save after making any changes here. </p>
