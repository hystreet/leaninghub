  <h1>Writing a Property Description</h1>
  <p>To edit the main text of a listing, go to <strong> Properties &gt; View (on the property) &gt; Listing &gt; Details</strong>.</p>
  <div class="text-center mb-30">

      <p class="caption-text">This tab will take you to the Listing details page</p>
    </div>
  </div>
    At the top of the page there is a description field.
    Enter the main property description here- don’t worry, this field will expand as you type (there’s no character limit).</p>

      <p class="caption-text">Enter the main text for the listing here</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Underneath the description, you’ll see a section for recording the sale status, Price qualifier and asking price.
    To the right of this you’ll see a set of fields for the property type and location.
    It may seem unnecessary to provide this information again, but this is to include the information on the listing.
    The first time you entered property details was to record the information on the database.</p>
  <div class="text-center mb-30">
    <div class="image-caption">
      <img src="/images/staff-site/sale-details.PNG" alt="screenshot of sale details fields">
      <p class="caption-text">This is where you add the details to the listing</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Underneath the property details section, you’ll see a field to add a key feature.
    Clicking <strong>‘add key feature’</strong> builds the list.</p>
  <div class="text-center mb-30">
    <div class="image-caption">
      <img src="/images/staff-site/key-features.PNG" alt="screenshot of key featues">
      <p class="caption-text">Add any key features here</p>
