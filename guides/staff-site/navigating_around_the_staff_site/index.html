    Clicking 'view' will take you into that property, where you'll see circular buttons for
    <strong>'property & Sellers'</strong>, <strong>'Valuation'</strong>, <strong>'Instruction & Payment'</strong>, <strong>'Compliance'</strong>, <strong>'Listing'</strong> and <strong>'On The Market'</strong>.</p>
