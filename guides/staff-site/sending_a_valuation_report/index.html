  <h1>Sending a Valuation Report</h1>
  <p>Once an agent has completed a valuation on the property, the highest, lowest, and recommended values can be recorded on the valuation report page.
    Once the fields have been filled and saved, hit <strong>'send report'</strong>.
    This will send the values over to the consumer site, so the buyer can then make a decision on instructing the agent to sell their home.</p>
