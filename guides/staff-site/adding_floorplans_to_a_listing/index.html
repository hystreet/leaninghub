  <h1>Adding Floorplans To a Listing</h1>
  <p>To add floorplans to the listing, go to the <strong>Floorplans</strong> page of the listing section and click ‘new floorplan’.
    The first field that shows up is for the floor name.
    This will be displayed on the ‘floorplans’ section of the consumer site listing.
    Once you’ve named the floor, hit save.
    After the floor name has been saved you’ll be able to upload a corresponding floorplan by clicking ‘choose file’ and selecting the desired file.
    Once it has been uploaded hit save again.</p>
