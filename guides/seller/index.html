  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-1"> Booking a Valuation </h2>

    <p> In the centre of the consumer site homepage, you’ll see an input field and a button that says: “book your free valuation”. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">
      <div class="image-caption">
        <img src="/images/book-a-valuation.PNG" alt="screenshot of postcode field">
        <p class="caption-text">This is where seller's will enter their postcodes</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>To start the selling process, your seller will just need to enter their postcode and hit 'book a free valuation'.
      If the entered postcode is covered by an agent, they’ll see a page introducing the agent.
      If the entered area doesn’t have an agent tied to it, they’ll see a message with your branch's contact number to arrange a valuation over the phone.</p>
    <p> Each step of the process for booking a valuation gathers some standard pre-valuation information (i.e. full address, property type, and estimated value).
      For each section, fill in the fields then click the button at the bottom of the page to move to the next section. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">
      <div class="image-caption">

        <p class="caption-text">We haven't made an image to go here just yet. Sorry about that.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> If this is the first time the seller has visited your Hystreet consumer site, The next step will ask them to enter to required details to create an account.
      They will need to enter their name, email address, password and contact number.
      If an account has already been added using the entered email address, the client will be notified when they try to move on to the next step.
      In this case, they will want to hit 'login' on your homepage before they try and book the valuation.</p>
    <p><em>TIP: as part of Hystreet's changes for GDPR, your clients will also be asked to choose when they would like to be contacted.
      Once logged in, they will also be albe to update these preferences by going to <strong> account > preferences </strong>.</em></p>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-3"> Getting to Market </h2>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-4"> Managing Availability </h2>
    <p> when the property is listed, potential buyers will book viewings against either the agent’s availability, the seller’s availability, or both availabilities at the same time.
      <a href="/guides/appointments">Our guide on appointments covers how these availabilties work.</a> </p>
    <p> If the seller is going to be present for the viewings (either alone or accompanied by an agent), they need to keep their availability updated so buyers have an accurate set of time slots to book viewings off.
      To do this go to ‘manage my availability’ from the account page. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">
      <div class="image-caption">
        <img src="/images/consumer-nav-availability.PNG" alt="screenshot of availability on consumer nav">
        <p class="caption-text">this is how clients navigate around the consumer site</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> From here, you’ll see a similar table to the one from booking a valuation.
      This time, simply check all the time slots that are available for viewings.
      buyers will see these times when following the consumer site ‘book a viewing’ process </p>
  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-5"> Feedback and Offers </h2>
    <p> once viewings have been carried out, buyers are prompted to leave feedback on the property.
