  <h1>The Valuation Report</h1>
  <p>Once the valuation report has been booked, the next step would be for the agent to actually go out and value the property.
    The Agent would then record the valuation details on the staff side of the platform - we've covered this in our <a href="/guides/staff-site/sending_a_valuation_report/">'Sending a Valuation Report' guide.</a></p>
  <p>The seller can then review this valuation report by logging back into the platform.</p>

    <p>If the seller is happy with the recommended marketing price, the next step step is to instruct and pay the agent!</p>
