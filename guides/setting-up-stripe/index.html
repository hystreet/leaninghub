  <h1>Setting Up Your Stripe Account</h1>
  <p>We use Stripe.com for processing your payments, as one of the largest online payment providers in the world they are both reliable and competitively priced.
    When you sign up for your Stripe account you’ll be provided with both a set of test keys and a set of live keys.
    Think of these keys like a deposit box that allows the system to process those payments on your behalf.</p>
  <p><a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register"> To get registered with stripe, head over to this page.</a>
    Once you've chosen your log in details, click 'create your Stripe account'.
    This will send a confirmation email to the entered address.
    follow the link in this email to confirm your account.</p>
  <p>Once you have followed the link and are logged in, click 'Activate your account' in the left hand column.
    This is where you provide all the neccessary details to start receiving payment.
    Complete that form, then click 'Activate acccount' at the bottom of the page.</p>
  <p>Stripe has excellent support documention, so go to <a href="https://support.stripe.com/">https://support.stripe.com/</a> if you've got any questions related to setting up a Stripe account</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  <p>After logging in, click 'developers' then follow the API link in the left hand column.
    This page will show you your publishable (public) and secret live keys.
    You’ll need to enter these two keys in the branch settings to take payments.</p>
  <p>On the right hand side of the stripe API page you will see a toggle to swap between showing your live and test keys.
  Simply click this to show your test keys instead.</p>

  <p>If you’re unsure of which keys you are currently using, take a look at the fields where you’ve entered the keys on the staff site.
    Near the start of each key you will see either the words ‘test’ or ‘live’.</P>
    <strong> Test Keys </strong> <br>
    <p> If you enter your test keys here (usually of the format sk_test_xxxx and pk_test_xxxx) you’ll be able to see how the system handles different responses for you using the test card numbers.
      For just running through some test customers and doing training the card number you are looking for is 4242 4242 4242 4242.
      With that card you can use any 3 digit CVC and any expiry date that is in the future.</p>
    <strong> Live Keys </strong> <br>
    <p> If you enter your live keys here (usually of the format sk_live_xxxx and pk_test_xxxx) you’ll be all set to start taking real world payments from customers!</p>
