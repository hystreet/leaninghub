  <h1>Data feed API v1</h1>

    This version is being deprecated. Please update to <a href="/guides/your-website/data-api/v2">version 2</a>
  </div>

  <p>The Hystreet data API is a way for 3rd party website developers to access the data within our system in their apps.
    The most common use of the API is to provide a listing of live properties on a marketing site.</p>
  <p><strong>Caveat: </strong>The API currently only supports propertiesâ€™ listings. If you need any other data, please get in contact with our support team.</p>

  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <h3>Authentication</h3>
  <p>In order to use our API you will need an authentication token. This can be obtained by speaking to our support team.
    Tokens need to be passed in as an <code>Authorization</code> request header, with the value as <code>Bearer &lt;authtoken&gt;</code></p>
  <p><Strong>For example:</strong></p>
  <p><code>curl -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer abc123&quot; https://demo.hystreet.co.uk/data-feed/v1/properties</code></p>
  <h3>Endpoints</h3>
  <p>The API URLs are relative to <code>https://&lt;your hystreet domain&gt;.hystreet.co.uk/data-feed/v1</code></p>
  <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
  <p><code>https://demo.hystreet.co.uk/data-feed/v1/properties</code></p>
  <h3>Output</h3>
  <p>The output is in JSON format. We have strived to keep the format as similar as possible to the RTDF format, but that does not necessarily make it the same.</p>

  <h2>Properties</h2>
  <p><code>/properties</code> returns a list of your published properties.</p>
  <p><strong>Request example:</strong></p>
  <p><code>curl -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer abc123&quot; https://demo.hystreet.co.uk/data-feed/v1/properties</code></p>
