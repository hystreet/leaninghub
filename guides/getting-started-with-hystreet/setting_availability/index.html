  <h1>Setting an Agent's availability</h1>
  <p><em>we've got a lot to tell you about availability, so we've put together a whole guide on the topics of Availability and Appointments.
    You can find our <a href="/guides/appointments/">Availability and Appointments Guide here.</a></em></p>
  <p>To make sure your agents are available for bookings, you'll want to keep their availability updated from the availability tab of the 'Agents' section.
    On this page, you’ll see a grid of checkboxes.
    Simply click the boxes to identify when you will be available for bookings.</p>
  <p>You can check the boxes at the very top of the grid if you want to make yourself available for the entire day.</p>
  <p>Click the arrows at the top right corner of the grid to scroll across to later dates.</p>
  <p>Once you’ve finished setting your availability, be sure to hit save so you don’t lose what you’ve just entered!</p>
