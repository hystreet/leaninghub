  <h1>Adding a New Staff Account</h1>
  <p>To add an account, go to the <strong>'Staff'</strong> page of the <strong>'Admin'</strong> section.
     click the <strong>‘Add account’</strong> button, complete the following fields and then click the <strong>‘Save’</strong> button.</p>
  <strong>name</strong><br>
  <p>This is for your reference so you know which account is which in the main list.</p>
  <strong>Email</strong><br>
  <p>Enter the staff member’s email address, this will act as their username for logging into the system.</p>
  <strong>Password</strong><br>
  <p>There are no restrictions on the password complexity, but we recommend using a strong password.
    Here is some <a href="https://www.getsafeonline.org/protecting-yourself/passwords/">Guidance on choosing strong passwords</a> and their importance.</p>
  <strong>Agent</strong><br>
  <p>If this user is also an Agent, then select the corresponding Agent in this dropdown list.
    This enables the system to automatically associate their calendar to their login and to show their appointments on their dashboard.
    If you can’t see the right Agent here then check that they have been <a href="/guides/getting-started-with-hystreet/adding_a_new_agent/">added as a new agent.</a></p>
