  <h1>Changing Your Password</h1>
  <p>If you ever need to update your password, you can do so from the 'Staff' section.
    Simply click 'view' on your name and type your new password into the 'password' field then hit save.</p>
  <p>If you are a user with 'admin' permissions, you can follow this same process to update any staff member's password.</p>
  <p>If you have forgotten your password and can't log in, you follow the 'forgot your password' link on the login page.
    You'll be asked to enter your email address, where you'll receive a link to go and reset your password.<p>
