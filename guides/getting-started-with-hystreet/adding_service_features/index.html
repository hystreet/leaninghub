  <h1>Adding Service Features</h1>
  <p>Once you have sent a valuation report, the next step would be for your clients to instruct and pay you.
  <p>As a reminder of the service your clients will be paying for, they will see a list of all of your service features before paying:</p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">
      <div class="image-caption">
        <img src="/images/admin/service-features-consumer.png" alt="screenshot of service features">
        <p class="caption-text">Let you're clients know what they are paying for here</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  <p>This list is fully customisable.
    You can add and remove points from the <strong>'settings'</strong> page of the admin section.</p>
  <p>Hit the <Strong>'Remove'</strong> button to take a feature off the list, or add new features at the bottom of the page.</p>
