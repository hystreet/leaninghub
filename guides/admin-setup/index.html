    <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="admin-part-2"> Configuring your agency </h2>
      <p> The first step is getting your branding on the system so that your customers get that seamless experience.
        These steps are all under the ‘Settings’ button in your Admin area.</P>
      <p><i>TIP: It’s worth clicking the ‘Save’ button whenever you enter any new information just in case you accidentally close or navigate away from a page. </i></p>

      <h3> Your Brand </h3>
      <p> We work with you to promote your brand, you’ll see some default placeholders with Hystreet on until you update your brand details.
        Just enter your ‘Brand Name’ as you’d like it to appear on the site and emails, then pop the URL for your main website into the ‘Brand URL’.
        (URL is the technical name for the address you use for your website such as www.estateagent.co.uk)</i> </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <div class="image-caption">
          <img src="/images/admin-settings-brand-name.png">
          <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3> Your Logo </h3>
      <p> Wherever you see a logo on Hystreet you can use your own brand logo which you can set yourself and update whenever you need to.
        Any changes made here will be live from the moment you click ‘Save’, give it a go and check your customer website to see for yourself!</P>
      <p> Simply click ‘Choose File’ and find the logo file on your computer.
        If you don’t have this file to hand you can come back to this page and upload it at any time.</P>
      <div class="text-center">
        <div class="image-caption">

          <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p> The second image is for a Favicon, this is the little logo that shows on the tab on the top of your browser.
        If you are unsure on this or can’t find the file then have a chat to your web developer.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3> Your Colours </h3>
      <p> It’s not just names and logos, you can also customise the main colours used.
        Mainly you’ll notice the change on buttons across the website but there are lots of subtle places where it’s used to make the site truly your own.</p>
      <p> For entering colours, we use the standard web system called Hex Colour Codes.
        It’s a bit like RGB which you might be more familiar with but using a different numbering system for each of the colours Red, Green and Blue.</p>
      <p> If you aren’t certain of your colour then check with your web site provider.
        If you are setting up a new brand then <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">follow this helpful link</a> for more information on picking your web colours. </p>
      <p> Once you have your colour codes, just enter them in (keeping the # symbol) and click ‘Save’ to see them on your site.</p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <div class="image-caption">

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3> Intercom (The Chat System) </h3>
      <p> If you like the chat system you saw on the demo videos, then you can register for this <a href="https://www.intercom.com">here.</a>
        If you don’t want this feature right now then just leave these fields blank.</p>
      <p> Once you’ve set yourself up with Intercom, just enter the details you’ll get from them here and Hystreet will automatically link your site up and turn the chat system on for you.</p>
      <p> If you need more assistance with this feature at any time then get in touch with your Customer Success Manager who will be able to help you out.</p>
      <div class="text-center">

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3> Contact Details </h3>
      <p> When your users see your contact details they are almost always speaking to a particular branch so we would show them the contact details for that branch.
        Just in case they are on one of the very few pages where that doesn’t apply we also ask you to put in a main contact email address or telephone number.
        This is just to make sure they can still get in touch with you if they need to. </p>
      <p> This can be updated at any time and as with all of our settings will update on the website the moment you click ‘Save’. </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <div class="image-caption">
          <img src="/images/contact-details-field.png">
          <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3> Book a Valuation Map </h3>
      <p> On the very first page of the book a valuation process (before we know a postcode or address) we like to show a map of the area you cover to help the customer get a feel for your area.
        As soon as we get their postcode it shows a map of their local area to re-enforce that personal feeling. </p>
      <p> You can set this up and change this yourself (for when you open more branches), simply enter the postcode you’d like the map to centre on and pick a zoom level.
        If it helps, most agents opt for zoom level 13.</p>
      <p> Click ‘Save’ and then check out the map by going to your main page and clicking the ‘Book a Valuation’ button.</p>
      <div class="text-center">

    <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="admin-part-3"> Setting up your first branch </h2>
      <p> Branch setup is where you get to set your branch name, contact details and addresses for system emails, but most importantly you get to set your pricing and configure your account to take payments! </P>
      <p> Under the ‘Branches’ button in your Admin area you’ll see your branch (or a list if you have more than one), simply click the ‘View’ button next to the branch you want to setup or update. </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <div class="image-caption">
          <img src="/images/branch-list-example.png">
          <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p> There are quite a few fields in this section so we’re going to list them one by one for you.
        The details you enter here will be used both on the website and in emails so it’s important to get them right. </P>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Branch Name:</b> Enter the name of your branch, if you have just the one branch then feel free to use your main company name. </li>
        <li> <b>Branch address:</b> Enter the full address for the branch you are setting up, it’s important to use the full address as this will also appear on the Memorandum of Sale. </li>
        <li> <b>Branch phone:</b> Enter the number for the branch that you’d like the customer to call you on if they have any issues. You can format this as you would like it to show just by putting spaces in the number. </li>
        <li> <b>Branch registration number:</b> This is your Companies House registration number, this is displayed on the footer of emails for you.
        <li> <b>No-reply email:</b> Emails sent from the system will show this as the reply address, so if your customer clicks reply on any of your emails they can be delivered back to you. To make sure your emails are successfully delivered and don’t go into Junk or Spam folders we’ll always set the From address to a Hystreet email address. </li>
        <li> <b>BCC email:</b> You can designate an email address to receive a copy of all emails sent out by the system. This isn’t compulsory but can be particularly useful if you have a branch or team mailbox so that everyone is actively notified of any updates on a property sale. </li>
        <li> <b>Support email:</b> This is not currently used but is in preparation for a future feature update. We’ll let you know when the feature is released. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Setting Your Main Fees </h3>
      <p> You can set your fees for each branch independently, so if you had a London branch for example, it’s common to set a higher fee for that branch. We’ll run through the fees here, but if you need any more information or help with these then get in
        touch with your Customer Success Manager. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Basic Service Fee: </b> This is the fee you want to charge for your core service, this doesn’t include any add-ons such as an EPC or accompanied viewings. </li>
        <li> <b>Accompanied Viewing Add-on Fee: </b> When instructing you your vendor is offered Accompanied Viewings as an add-on that they can pick. The instruction process automatically shows the fee you enter here and will calculate the payment for them just like checking out on a shopping website. </li>
        <li> <b>EPC Add-on Fee: </b> Your vendor will also be offered the opportunity to order an EPC from you during instruction. Again the instruction process automatically shows the fee you enter here and will calculate the payment for them just like checking out on a shopping website. </li>
        <li> <b>Additional Launch Visits Fee: </b> If you want your staff to charge for additional launch visits, then record the amount here. In the future we will be adding in automation to help handle this automatically for you. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Other Fees </h3>
      <p> <b> you must speak to your legal team </b> to confirm the best way for you to manage this, but we have included fields for you to record some common fees that might be used to cover you for work done. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Admin charge fee </li>
        <li> Launch fee </li>
        <li> Market preparation fee </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Portal Details </h3>
      <p>These fields are used if you wish to use us to manage your portal uploads on your behalf. Feel free to discuss the best way to manage this for your business with your Customer Success Manager. </p>
      <p>You won’t need to populate these yourself as we’ll get the information from the portals when you instruct them to use us for your feed(s). </p>

      <h3> Stripe Information </h3>
      <p> We use Stripe.com for processing your payments, as one of the largest online payment providers in the world they are both reliable and competitively priced.
        When you sign up for your Stripe account you’ll be provided with both a set of test keys and a set of live keys.
        Think of these keys like a deposit box that allows the system to process those payments on your behalf. </p>
      <b> Test Keys </b> <br>
      <p> If you enter your test keys here (usually of the format sk_test_xxxx and pk_test_xxxx) you’ll be able to see how the system handles different responses for you using the test card numbers.
        For just running through some test customers and doing training the card number you are looking for is 4242 4242 4242 4242.
        With that card you can use any 3 digit CVC and any expiry date that is in the future. </p>
      <b> Live Keys </b> <br>
      <p> If you enter your live keys here (usually of the format sk_live_xxxx and pk_test_xxxx) you’ll be all set to start taking real world payments from customers! </p>
    </div>

    <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="admin-part-4"> Setting up your first agent </h2>
      <p> Initially under the ‘Agent’ button in your Admin area you’ll just see a box saying ‘No Agents’, later on this will show a list of any Agents you have configured. </P>
      <p><i> TIP: This section sets up an Agent, if you need them to access the staff site you’ll need to add a <a href="#admin-part-5">Staff Login </a> as well </p></i>
      <img class="image-75-centered" src="/images/no-agents-box.png">
      <div class="text-center">
  <div class="image-caption">
    <img src="/images/no-agents-box.png">
    <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
  </div>
</div>
      <p> Either click the ‘Add Agent’ button to add an Agent or to edit an existing Agent simply click the ‘View’ button next to the Agent you want to update.
        You’ll see the same fields for both. </p>

      <h3> Agent Details </h3>
      <p> The first page is where you enter the details for the agent.</p>
      <b> Active Checkbox </b> <br>
      <p> You can change the active status of an Agent at any time, simply check or uncheck this box and click ‘Save’.
        Please note that the postcodes associated with that Agent will only be available to book valuations on if the Agent is marked as ‘Active’. </p>
      <b> Contact Details </b> <br>
      <p> You can enter (or update) the following contact details for the Agent to be used on the website and in emails: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Agent Forename </li>
	      <li> Agent Surname </li>
	      <li> Contact Number </li>
	      <li> Email Address </li>
      </ul>
      <b> Bio & Experience </b> <br>
      <p> Here you should enter a little bit about the agent to help your customers get to know them.
        This is used on the introduction page as part of booking a valuation.
        Here you can see the fields side by side: </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <div class="image-caption">
          <div class="columns large-6 text-center">

      </div>
      <b> Branch </b> <br>
      <p> Select the Agent’s corresponding branch from the dropdown here.
        If you can’t see the right branch then check you have set up your branch correctly in the section <a href="#admin-part-3"> Setting up your branch.</a>

      <h3> The Agent’s Photo </h3>
      <p>To give that truly personal feel to customer’s using your website, you can upload a photo of the Agent on this page.
        It isn’t mandatory to upload a photo but we strongly recommend that you upload a photo for each of your agents as we’ve found this works really well for both vendors and buyers. </p>
      <p> If you can’t see the option to upload a photo then you may not have saved your new Agent yet.
        Click the ‘Save’ button and the option will appear. </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <div class="image-caption">

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3> Agent districts </h3>
      <p> You can assign each Agent a set of postcode districts.
        This allows the system to automatically assign any new customers to the right Agent for you.
        To add a new postcode district, start typing in the ‘Add postcode district’ field and a list will appear for you to pick from (or just type it in).
        Click ‘Save’ and you’ll see the postcode district added to the list. </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="columns large-9 text-center">
          <img src="/images/set-districts.png"> </div>
        <div class="columns large-3 text-center">
          <img src="/images/add-new-district.png"> </div>
      </div>
      <b> Removing a postcode district </b> <br>
      <p> To remove a postcode district just click the cross next to the district you would like to remove.
        No need to save on this occasion, the district will disappear straight away. </p>
      <h3> Agent Availability </h3>
      <p> Setting Agent availability is a simple case of ticking the timeslots you would like them to be available for on the ‘Availability’ tab.
        You can either tick/untick individual timeslots or use the tick boxes under each date to tick/untick all the appointments in that day.
        You can enter up to six weeks’ availability at a time by using the arrow buttons to scroll across. </p>
      <p> <i> TIP: Remember to click ‘Save’ once you have made your changes. </i> </p>

    <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="admin-part-5"> Setting up your staff logins </h2>
      <p> Staff setup is where you get to create or update any staff logins for your team.
        Remember that you may need to create logins for your Agents as well. </P>
      <p> Under the ‘Staff’ button in your Admin area you’ll initially see one user for Hystreet Support, this is so that we can quickly assist with any issues you might have. </p>
      <div class="text-center">

      <b> Agent </b> <br>
