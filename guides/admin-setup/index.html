<div><h2 class="anchor" id="admin-part-2"> Configuring your agency </h2>

  <p> The first step is getting your branding on the system so that your customers get that seamless experience.
    These steps are all under the ‘Settings’ button in your Admin area.</P>
  <p><b>TIP: It’s worth clicking the ‘Save’ button whenever you enter any new information just in case you accidentally close or navigate away from a page. </b></p>

  <h3> Your Brand </h3>
  <p> We work with you to promote your brand, you’ll see some default placeholders with Hystreet on until you update your brand details.
    Just enter your ‘Brand Name’ as you’d like it to appear on the site and emails, then pop the URL for your main website into the ‘Brand URL’.
  <i> (URL is the technical name for the address you use for your website such as www.estateagent.co.uk)</i> </p>
  <img class="image-75-centered" src="/images/admin-settings-brand-name.png">

  <h3> Your Logo </h3>
  <p> Wherever you see a logo on Hystreet you can use your own brand logo which you can set yourself and update whenever you need to.
    Any changes made here will be live from the moment you click ‘Save’, give it a go and check your customer website to see for yourself!</P>
  <p> Simply click ‘Choose File’ and find the logo file on your computer.
    If you don’t have this file to hand you can come back to this page and upload it at any time.</P>
  <img class="image-75-centered" src="/images/logo-favicon-upload.png">
  <p> The second image is for a Favicon, this is the little logo that shows on the tab on the top of your browser.
    If you are unsure on this or can’t find the file then have a chat to your web developer.</p>

  <h3> Your Colours </h3>
  <p> It’s not just names and logos, you can also customise the main colours used.
    Mainly you’ll notice the change on buttons across the website but there are lots of subtle places where it’s used to make the site truly your own.</p>
  <p> For entering colours, we use the standard web system called Hex Colour Codes.
    It’s a bit like RGB which you might be more familiar with but using a different numbering system for each of the colours Red, Green and Blue.</p>
  <p> If you aren’t certain of your colour then check with your web site provider.
    If you are setting up a new brand then <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">follow this helpful link</a> for more information on picking your web colours. </p>
  <p> Once you have your colour codes, just enter them in (keeping the # symbol) and click ‘Save’ to see them on your site.</p>

  <h3> Intercom (The Chat System) </h3>
  <p> If you like the chat system you saw on the demo videos, then you can register for this <a href="https://www.intercom.com">here</a>
    If you don’t want this feature right now then just leave these fields blank.</p>
  <p> Once you’ve set yourself up with Intercom, just enter the details you’ll get from them here and Hystreet will automatically link your site up and turn the chat system on for you.</p>
  <p> If you need more assistance with this feature at any time then get in touch with your Customer Success Manager who will be able to help you out.</p>
  <img class="image-75-centered" src="/images/intercom-setup-fields.png">

  <h3> Contact Details </h3>
  <p> When your users see your contact details they are almost always speaking to a particular branch so we would show them the contact details for that branch.
    Just in case they are on one of the very few pages where that doesn’t apply we also ask you to put in a main contact email address or telephone number.
    This is just to make sure they can still get in touch with you if they need to. </p>
  <p> This can be updated at any time and as with all of our settings will update on the website the moment you click ‘Save’. </p>
  <img class="image-75-centered" src="/images/contact-details-field.png">

  <h3> Book a Valuation Map </h3>
  <p> On the very first page of the book a valuation process (before we know a postcode or address) we like to show a map of the area you cover to help the customer get a feel for your area.
    As soon as we get their postcode it shows a map of their local area to re-enforce that personal feeling. </p>
  <p> You can set this up and change this yourself (for when you open more branches), simply enter the postcode you’d like the map to centre on and pick a zoom level.
    If it helps, most agents opt for zoom level 13.</p>
  <p> Click ‘Save’ and then check out the map by going to your main page and clicking the ‘Book a Valuation’ button.</p>

<div><h2 class="anchor" id="admin-part-3"> Setting up your first branch </h2>
  <p> Branch setup is where you get to set your branch name, contact details and addresses for system emails, but most importantly you get to set your pricing and configure your account to take payments! </P>
  <p> Under the ‘Branches’ button in your Admin area you’ll see your branch (or a list if you have more than one), simply click the ‘View’ button next to the branch you want to setup or update. </p>
  <img class="image-75-centered" src="/images/branch-list-example.png">
  <p> There are quite a few fields in this section so we’re going to list them one by one for you.
    The details you enter here will be used both on the website and in emails so it’s important to get them right.

  <ul>
    <li> <b>Branch Name:</b> Enter the name of your branch, if you have just the one branch then feel free to use your main company name. </li>
    <li> <b>Branch address:</b> Enter the full address for the branch you are setting up, it’s important to use the full address as this will also appear on the Memorandum of Sale. </li>
    <li> <b>Branch phone:</b> Enter the number for the branch that you’d like the customer to call you on if they have any issues. You can format this as you would like it to show just by putting spaces in the number. </li>
    <li> <b>Branch registration number:</b> This is your Companies House registration number, this is displayed on the footer of emails for you. </li>
    <li> <b>No-reply email:</b> Emails sent from the system will show this as the reply address, so if your customer clicks reply on any of your emails they can be delivered back to you. </li> To make sure your emails are successfully delivered and don’t go into Junk or Spam folders we’ll always set the From address to a Hystreet email address. </li>
    <li> <b>BCC email:</b> You can designate an email address to receive a copy of all emails sent out by the system. This isn’t compulsory but can be particularly useful if you have a branch or team mailbox so that everyone is actively notified of any updates on a property sale. </li>
    <li> <b>Support email:</b> This is not currently used but is in preparation for a future feature update. We’ll let you know when the feature is released. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Setting your main fees </h3>
   <p> You can set your fees for each branch independently, so if you had a London branch for example, it’s common to set a higher fee for that branch.
     We’ll run through the fees here, but if you need any more information or help with these then get in touch with your Customer Success Manager. </p>
