  <h1>Using the 'viewings by' function</h1>
  <p>The ‘viewings’ by function allows you to determine whether viewings can be booked against your availability as an agent, the seller’s availability, or a mix of both.
    To do this, go to the staff site and click <strong>Properties &gt; View (on the property)</strong> and then click on the <strong>Manage cog</strong> at the bottom of the left side bar.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Click on the ‘viewings by’ dropdown to select how you would like viewings on that property to be managed, then hit save. </p>
  <p>Use ‘viewings by: agent’ if you are managing viewings for the property without the presence of the seller. </p>
  <p>Use ‘viewings by: seller’ if the seller is going to manage the viewings independently.</p>
  <p>Use ‘viewings by: both agent and seller’ if your seller is managing the viewings has requested accompanied viewings</p>`
