  <h1>How to book a take on</h1>
  <p>Once you have been paid and instructed to sell a property, you will want to book a take on appointment.
    To do this, go to <strong>Properties &gt; View (on the property) &gt; Listing &gt; Book a take on &gt; Add a take on appointment.</strong></p>
  <div class="text-center mb-30">
    <div class="image-caption">

      <p class="caption-text">Click this to book a take on</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Select the agent that is going to carry out the take on, then select the date and time for the appointment.</p>
  <p>When selecting a time for the appointment from the staff site, you will be shown which time slots are available or already booked, but you can book the appointment in any slot.</p>
  <p>When you've chosen a date and time, click save to book the appointment.
    At this point, you'll probably want to send a booking confirmation email to the seller by clicking <strong>'Send booked email'</strong>.</p>
