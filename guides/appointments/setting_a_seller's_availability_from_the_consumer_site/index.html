  <h1>Setting a seller's availability from the consumer site </h1>
  <p>If a seller is managing their own viewings, they will need to set their availability to make sure that buyers are shown time slots to book viewings.</p>
  <p>A seller can set their own availability by going to <strong>Account &gt; Manage my sale &gt; Manage my Availability</strong>.
    From there, sellers can update their availability in the same way that agents manage their availability from the staff site.</p>
  <p>Once they have marked out their desired availability, they can click ‘update availability’ to save their changes.</p>
