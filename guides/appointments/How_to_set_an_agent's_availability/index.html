  <h1>How to set an agent's availability</h1>
  <p>As an agent, it’s a good idea to update your availability regularly to make sure that your clients can book appointments from the consumer site. If you haven’t set your availability for a day, your clients won’t be able to book appointments.</p>
  <p>To set your availability, go to the staff site and click <strong>Admin > Agents > View (on your name) > Availability.</strong> From there, you’ll see a grid of checkboxes. Simply click the boxes to identify when you will be available for bookings. </p>
  <p>You can check the boxes at the very top of the grid if you want to make yourself available for the entire day.</p>
  <p>Click the arrows at the top right corner of the grid to scroll across to later dates.</p>
  <p>Once you’ve finished setting your availability, be sure to hit save so you don’t lose what you’ve just entered!</p>
