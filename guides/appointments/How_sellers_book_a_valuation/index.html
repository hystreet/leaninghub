  <h1>How sellers book a valuation</h1>
  <p>Sellers can book a valuation from the consumer site by entering their postcode on the home page and clicking ‘book your free valuation’. Please note, you will need an active agent covering their post code area.</p>
  <p>Providing that there is an agent covering the agent, the seller will be asked to select their address from a dropdown menu, then provide valuation details.</p>
  <p>Once all the valuation details have been entered, the seller will be presented with a table of all available time slots to pick their valuation time from. </p>
  <p>Clicking ‘yep, that works for me’ will take them to the appointment confirmation page.</p>
