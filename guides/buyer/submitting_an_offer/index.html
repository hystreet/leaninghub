  <h1>Submitting an offer</h1>
  <p><em>TIP: This guide covers the buyers perspective.
    If you'd like to find out more about offers from a seller's perspective, try <a href="/guides/seller">our seller's guide</a>.</em></p>
  <p>Once a buyer has left feedback on a property, they will be asked if they would like to submit an offer.</p>

      <p class="caption-text">buyers will see this box immediately after leaving feedback</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To make sure your records are up to date and nothing has changed since the viewing was booked, the buyer will be asked to re-enter purchase position and funding methods.</p>
  <p>They will then be able to type in their offer value and any conditions they'd like to add to the offer.
    When the buyer hits submit they will be sent an automatic email to confirm the offer has gone through.
    The seller and agent will also both receive email notifications of the new offer.</p>
