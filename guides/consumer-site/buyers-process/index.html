      <p> When following the “book a viewing” link, you’ll be taken to a page with the featured image of the property on the right and a set of boxes to the left. At the bottom of the left hand column you’ll see the button to take you on to the next step
        of the booking process. The fields you’ll see will look something like this: </p>

      <p> To find out more about how the appointment slots in this process are set, take a look over here. Once you’ve followed this process through you’ll see a message to inform you that your viewing has been provisionally booked. To confirm the booking,
        you simply need to follow the link sent to you by email. If you can’t find the email, you can resend it by clicking the button on the banner across the top of the page. If you can’t see the banner, then don’t worry! You have already confirmed
        your email address. </p>

      <p> After you’ve booked a viewing, you’ll see the property from your account page, listed under “properties you’re interested in”, along with any other properties you have arranged viewings for.
        Clicking on the property from here will take you manage your purchase. </p>

    <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="buyers-part-3"> Managing your purchase </h2>
      <p> Clicking on the property you are interested in will show you the steps involved completing a purchase. Here are the steps: </p>

      <h3> Step 1: Book a Viewing </h3>
      <p> This was covered in the previous section, in case you’re unsure on how to find the “book a viewing” link, or if you've come straight to this section, take a look <a href="#buyers-part-1"> over here </a> </p>

      <h3> Step 2: Submit Feedback </h3>
      <p> After you have been to a viewing, you’ll be asked to provide feedback. To do so, click ‘provide feedback’.
        This will direct you to the feedback form. Feedback uses an intuitive 5-star rating system.
        Click the star that you want to rate each aspect of the property, then click submit feedback. </p>
        <img src="/images/feedback-form.png">

      <h3> Step 3: Offer Negotiation </h3>
      <p> Once you’ve given feedback, you’ll be provided with the option to make an offer. You can either start the ‘making an offer’ process on the page immediately after submitting feedback, or from your account page at another time.
        On the offer form, you will be asked to state how the purchase would be funded and state the value of the offer along with any other conditions you have.
        Once that’s done,  hit submit and the vendor will be notified of the new offer.</p>

      <h3> Step 4: Finalise your Purchase </h3>

      <h3> Step 4: Finalise your Purchase </h3>

        Right now, the agency team will handle the sale to finalise your purchase once the vendor of the property has accepted an offer. </p>
