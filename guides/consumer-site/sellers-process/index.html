  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-3"> Getting to Market </h2>
    <p> This stage covers everything needed from the consumer leading up to posting the property listing online.
      Whilst this section is being completed by the consumer, the agent would normally be creating the listing on the staff side.</p>
    <b> book a launch: </b> <br>
    <p> after payment has been received, the next step is to arrange a launch.

      Check the time slot that best suits you, and then click ‘book property launch’.
      You’ll be given some tips on how to best prepare for the launch, followed by a confirmation page.
      As with booking a valuation, the appointment can be amended or cancelled at any time. </p>

    <p> This section of the “getting to market” checklist is a legal requirement.
      The first page you see after clicking complete ID check should be read carefully.
      Once you’ve read through everything, check the box to show that you understand what the ID check entails, the hit ‘let’s start the ID check’. </p>

      As with the ID check, read the important information and check the box to confirm that you are completing the fact find as accurately as possible (to the best of your knowledge).

  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-4"> Managing Availability </h2>
    <p> when the property is listed, potential buyers will book viewings against either the agent’s availability, the seller’s availability, or both availabilities at the same time.
      To Find out more about how availabilities work, go <a href="http://learninghub.hystreet.co.uk/coming-soon"> here. </a> </p>
    <p> If the seller is going to be present for the viewings (either alone or accompanied by an agent), they need to keep their availability updated so buyers have an accurate set of time slots to book viewings off.
      To do this go to ‘manage my availability’ from the account page. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">
      <div class="image-caption">
        <img src="/images/consumer-nav-availability.PNG">
        <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> From here, you’ll see a similar table to the one from booking a valuation.
      This time, simply check all the time slots that are available for viewings.
      buyers will see these times when following the consumer site ‘book a viewing’ process </p>
  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-5"> Feedback and Offers </h2>
    <p> once viewings have been carried out, buyers are prompted to leave feedback on the property.
      More information on how buyers leave feedback can be found <a href="http://learninghub.hystreet.co.uk/guides/consumer-site/buyers-process/#buyers-part-3">here.</a>
      Vendors are able to view feedback either by clicking ‘view feedback’ on from the step four section of the account page, or by going to feedback on the navigation bar at the top of the page. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">
      <div class="image-caption">
        <div class="columns large-9 text-center">

        </div>
        <p class="caption-text">This is the caption for the image</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> From the feedback page, you’ll see a box for each buyer that has left feedback.
      Clicking on the box will show you how the buyer rated the property. </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-30">

      </div>
    </div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-6"> Finalising the Sale </h2>
