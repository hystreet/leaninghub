  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-1"> Booking a Valuation </h2>

    <p> In the centre of the consumer site homepage, you’ll see an input field and a button that says: “book your free valuation”. </p>
    <img src="/images/book-a-valuation.PNG">
    <p>Enter the postcode of the property you intend to sell and hit the button to start the selling process.
      If the entered postcode is covered by an agent, you’ll see a page introducing the agent.
      Go here to find out where the agent image, bio and experience sections come from.
      If the entered area doesn’t have an agent tied to it, you’ll see a message letting you know. </p>
    <p> Each step of the process for booking a valuation gathers the important property information (i.e. the location, property type, expected valuation) and seller contact details.
      For each section, fill in the fields then click the button at the bottom of the page to move to the next section. </p>
    <img src="">
    <p> The last step will show you a table of available time slots for to choose from.
      Once the valuation time has been picked, you’ll be taken to a confirmation page.
      You can amend or cancel the valuation time at any point. </p>
    <img src="/images/valuation-booked.PNG">
    <p> At the bottom of this page you’ll see a button to take you back to your account page.
      There is also an Account button at the top right of the screen to take you there- you’ll see this button from on anywhere on the site.</p>
  </div>

  <div> <h2 class="anchor" id="sellers-part-2"> instructing to sell </h2>
    <p> from the account page, click “manage my sale”.
      This will lead you to a page showing all the steps involved in selling a property. </p>
    <p> Once an agent has been to the property and completed a valuation, you’ll be prompted to instruct the agent to start selling the property.
      Click the button to make the instruction. </p>
    <img src="/images/instruct-to-sell-button.PNG">
    <p> The following page will allow you to choose which addons to include in the instruction (prices for these can be set through the admin section).
      Check the box to accept the terms and conditions then hit continue at the bottom of the page.
      Next, you’ll see the fields to enter card details for paying for the instruction. </p>
