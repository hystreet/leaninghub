  <h1>Template Emails for your account managers</h1>
  <p>If you are getting set up with the Hystreet platform, you'll need to arrange a new data feed to publish your listings.
    You can use the email template below to get the conversation with your account manager started:</p>
  <br>
  <p><em>Hi <strong>&lt;account manager name&gt;</strong>,</em></p>
  <p><em>We are currently in the process of setting up an online service to run parallel to  <strong>&lt;agency&gt;</strong>'s traditional service.
    This online option will be powered by Hystreet, and in order to publish listings generated on this platform, we require a second profile under the <strong>&lt;agency&gt;</strong>.
    Please could you confirm the additional monthly cost to have this second profile running along side our existing CRM?</em></p>
  <p><em>Kind regards,</em></p>
