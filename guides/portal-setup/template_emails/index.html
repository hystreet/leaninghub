  <h1>Template Emails for your account managers</h1>
  <p>Once you have decided on the approach you want to take (see examples below or speak to your Hystreet Customer Success Manager) all you need to do is contact your portal account manager(s) and ask them to set up a new profile for you.
  <p> you can use this email template to get the conversation with your account managers started:</p>
  <div class="shortline"></div>
  <p><em>Hi <strong>&lt;account manager name&gt;</strong>,</em></p>
  <p><em>We are currently in the process of setting up an online service to run parallel to  <strong>&lt;agency&gt;</strong>'s traditional service.
    This online option will be powered by Hystreet, and in order to publish listings generated on this platform, we require a second profile under the  <strong>&lt;agency&gt;</strong> brand with a branch ID that is specific to the Hystreet network.
    Please could you provide us with a second branch ID that is part of the Hystreet network?
    Additionally, Please can you confirm the additional monthly cost to have this second provide along side our existing CRM?</em></p>
  <p><em>Kind regards,</em></p>
