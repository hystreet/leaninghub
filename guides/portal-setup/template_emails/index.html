  <h1>Template Emails for your account managers</h1>
  <p>If you are using the Hystreet platform to handle an online service, you'll need to arrange a new data feed to publish your listings.</p>
  <p> you can use the email template below to get the conversation with your account manager started:</p>
  <br>
  <p><em>Hi <strong>&lt;account manager name&gt;</strong>,</em></p>
  <p><em>We are currently in the process of setting up an online service to run parallel to  <strong>&lt;agency&gt;</strong>'s traditional service.
    This online option will be powered by Hystreet, and in order to publish listings generated on this platform, we require a second profile under the  <strong>&lt;agency&gt;</strong> brand with a branch ID that is specific to the Hystreet network.
    Please could you provide us with a second branch ID that is part of the Hystreet network and confirm the additional monthly cost to have this second provide along side our existing CRM?</em></p>
  <p><em>Kind regards,</em></p>
