  <h1>Setting Up Your Portals</h1>
  <p>Hystreet can automatically publish your properties to the portals for you, even updating the listing automatically for you when the status changes (For Sale, Under Offer & SSTC).</p>
  <p>Initially you’ll be provided with buttons on the staff interface for publishing/updating your listings but once you are comfortable with the process just let our support team know and we’ll enable the full automation for you!</p>
  <p>We are integrated with the leading portals - Rightmove, Zoopla and OnTheMarket.
    The process for setting up each is the same though depending on your account manager(s) they may have slightly different terminology for each.</p>
  <h2 style="padding-top:100px;" id="portal-setup-1">Profiles</h2>
  <p>Your portal provider will have set you up with a profile for your branch, this may be a profile for Sales, or one for Lettings.
    If you offer both Sales and Lettings then they will have set you up with a profile for each of those.</p>
  <p>The portals can only take one ‘feed’ per profile, this means that you can’t have two CRM providers publishing properties into one profile.</p>
  <h2 style="padding-top:100px;" id="portal-setup-2">Getting Started</h2>
  <p>Once you have decided on the approach you want to take (see examples below or speak to your Hystreet Customer Success Manager) all you need to do is contact your portal account manager(s) and ask them to set up a new profile for you.
    They’ll be able to advise on their internal process and any information or artwork they will need to get your profile up and running.</p>
  <p>Once they are ready they will contact Hystreet directly and we’ll get the security and feeds configured for you.</p>
  <p>As we are dependent on the portals themselves the time for this process can vary but we’ll make sure we get you live as quickly as possible so you can start publishing properties!</p>
  <h2 style="padding-top:100px;" id="portal-setup-3">Example Setup</p2>
  <p>There are many possible combinations but we’ve included a few of the most common setups below as a visual guide:</p>
