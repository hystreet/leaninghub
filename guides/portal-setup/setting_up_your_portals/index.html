  <h1>Setting Up Your Portals</h1>
  <p>Hystreet can automatically publish your properties to the portals for you, even updating the listing automatically for you when the status changes (For Sale, Under Offer &amp; SSTC).</p>
  <p>Initially you’ll be provided with buttons on the staff interface for making your listing live on the client-facing end of the platform.
   Once you are comfortable with the process of getting listings to market, get in touch with our support team to start publishing to portals!</p>
  <p>We are integrated with the leading portals - Rightmove, Zoopla and OnTheMarket.
    The process for setting up each is the same, though depending on the portal, they may have slightly different terminology for each.</p>
  <p>All you need to do to start the setup process is contact your portal account manager(s) and ask them to set up a <strong>new profile</strong> for you.
    They’ll be able to advise on their internal process and request any information or artwork they will need to get your profile up and running.</p>
  <p> Most of the Portal setup goes on behind in the scenes.
    Your Account manager will arrange a <strong>Branch ID</strong> and will usually send it directly to our tech team.
    If your account manager does give you the branch ID directly, just send it straight over to our support team.</p>
  <p>If you have published your listings from another CRM in the past, you'll probably already have a Branch ID saved somewhere.
    <strong>This branch ID won't work with the Hystreet system</strong>
    You will need to speak to your account manager to get a new profile and branch ID arranged that is set up for your Hystreet platform</p>
