      <h3>Step 1: Book a Demo</h3>
      <p>First off, all you need to do is book an online demo to see our product in action for yourself. Either book a demo online, or get in touch to arrange a time that suits you.</p>
      <p>You don’t even have to leave the comfort of your office! A member of our demo team will share their screen with you online, showing you how the product works for other agents out in the real world, outlining how it can benefit you, and answering any questions you may have.</p>

       <h3>Step 2: Sign up</h3>
      <p>Happy with what you see? Fantastic! All you have to do next is sign your contract and fill out our on boarding questionnaire, which gives us all the information we need to start putting together your bespoke Hystreet platform.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Let us do the hard work…</h3>
      <p>Once we have everything we need, it’s time to get your platform set up. We will liaise with your web developers and other providers to make your Hystreet platform the perfect fit for your business, installing your brand, colours, and setting up your first users, so it’s all ready for you. Sit back, relax, and know that everything is being taken care of, whilst we inform you of our progress every step of the way. You don’t start paying until everything is up and running.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Start winning online instructions</h3>
      <p>Once everything is running and integrated with your website, you can start winning instructions and making money with online customers that very same day. It’s time to fight back against online agencies with your genuine local expertise, and a cutting-edge online platform that’s accessible to your users 24/7.</p>
